\section{NON API DATA}
The data set i picked was a list of data sets of outcomes of different types of games such as poker, etc. I picked this because i thought it was funny to have a data set of data sets, and because I've been practicing predicting and probabilities in R and they would be helpful in continuing to do that. I will say originally I tried to pull data on towns in ireland, but i was afraid it might not be static, but the issue ended up being google chrome. In terms of info that I used online, it was mostly just resources from the github, but i tried to look up ways to get the elements needed to scrape from google chrome, which again didn't work at all.

\section{API DATA}

For this project i downloaded Income from taxes on trade, which is interesting because these taxes are often touted as 1). A way to keep businesses inside the United States (with dubious evidence) but also as a way to raise money. It can also tell us something about the level of tariffs being applied in any given year, which I think is interesting. This in hand with maybe with other datasets, could lead to some very interesting analysis.
